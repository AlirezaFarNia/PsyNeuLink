Dopamine and Temporal Differences Learning (Montague et al., 1996)
==================================================================

This implements a model of the mesolimbic dopamine cell activity during monkey
conditioning as found in `Montague, Dayan, and Sejnowski (1996). <http://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/16/5/1936.full.pdf>`_

The plots below were generated by PsyNeuLink. The original plots can be found 
in Figures 5A-C in the original paper.

The first plot shows ∂(t) over time for three trials during 
training. In PsyNeuLink, ∂(t) is the output of the 
`PredictionErrorMechanism <PredictionErrorMechanism>`, which is 
created automatically by 
`LearningProjections <LearningProjection>` called with 
`TDLearning <TDLearning>` as its learning function.

The second plot shows ∂(t) over all 100 trials of the model responses.

The third plot demonstrates extinction of response to the stimulus by 
non-delivery of the reward after trial 70.

All of the functions to create the plots can be found in `MontagueModel.py`. 
Plot 1, 2, and 3 can be generated by running the functions `montague_model_training()`,
`montague_model_training_full_experiment()`, and 
`montague_model_response_extinction()`, respectively. 
All three plots can be generated by running `python MontagueModel.py` from the 
command line or `%run MontagueModel.py` inside a Jupyter notebook or from the 
iPython shell.
